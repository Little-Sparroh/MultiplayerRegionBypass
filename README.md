# RegionBypass

A BepInEx mod for MycoPunk that bypasses the region lock in the server browser, allowing players to see and join lobbies from all regions worldwide.

## Description

MycoPunk's server browser normally only displays lobbies within your region due to Steam's matchmaking regional filtering. This mod patches the game's configuration system to force the lobby search distance to worldwide, bypassing the regional restrictions and allowing you to join ANY lobby regardless of location.

The mod is client-side only and uses Harmony to patch the `PlayerOptions.TryGetConfig` method for robust compatibility across game updates.
